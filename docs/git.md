# Git Commit Guidelines

## Branch Requirements

- For every feature addition or optimization, create a feature branch from `develop` before making changes.
- Commit all related code changes on the feature branch.
- Feature branch names must use the format `feature-<brief-feature-description>`.

## When to Commit

- Commit after each logically complete change
- Do not combine unrelated changes into one commit
- Prefer multiple small commits over one large commit

## Commit Message Format

Use Conventional Commits:

`<type>(<scope>): <summary>`

Allowed types:

- feat
- fix
- refactor
- test
- docs
- chore

Rules:

- Summary must be in imperative mood
- Summary must be concise (≤ 72 characters)
- No trailing period

Examples:

- fix(cache): prevent memory leak on eviction
- refactor(router): extract middleware pipeline
- test(auth): add refresh token edge cases

## Commit Content Rules

- Each commit must compile and pass tests
- Do not include formatting-only changes unless explicitly requested
- Do not include generated files unless required

## Commit Safety

- Avoid force-push
- Never rewrite published history

## Commit Intent

- Commit message must explain *why* the change exists, not only *what*
- Avoid vague messages like "update code" or "fix issue"

## Multi-step Changes

- If a task requires multiple steps, create commits in this order:
    1. Add or update tests
    2. Implement logic changes
    3. Refactor or cleanup
